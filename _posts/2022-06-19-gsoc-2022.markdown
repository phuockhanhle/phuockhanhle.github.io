## Project description
The main idea of IQS in digiKam is to determine the quality of an image and convert it into a score. This score is based on four criteria which are factors sabotaging image: blur, noise, exposure, and compression. The current approach is useful to determine images distorted by one of these reasons. However, the current algorithm presents also some drawbacks : It demands a lots of fine tuning from user's side and it's cannot work on aesthetic image. So, I propose the solution of deep learning algorithm. While the dataset and the paper for aesthetic image quality assessment are free to use, we are capable of constructing a mathematical model that can learn the pattern of a dataset, hence, predict the score of quality. As deep learning is an end-to-end solution, it doesnâ€™t require the setting for the hyperparameters. Hence, we can reduce most of the fine-tuning parts to make this feature easier to use
